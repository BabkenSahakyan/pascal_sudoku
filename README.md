# sudoku in pascal

This is my first ever "project" in some sense and it is published for the first time, for my friend. I anderstand that the codes are shitty but I'm pushing it without any code review.

For my friend: If you are lucky enough to run this shit please tell me how you did it :d and write simple guide if you would like.

For me: Pascal is <3
